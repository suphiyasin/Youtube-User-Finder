```
# Why
Imagine that you have a product in your hand and let's assume that this product is added to the meals.<br/>
You want to advertise this to someone who has a youtube channel, but you have difficulty choosing the youtube channel (contact emails or it is difficult to visit all channels)<br/>
that's exactly what YUF does.<br/>
When you write words like food hamburger ear fastfood in scan.txt and run them, it will write you the e-mails of the channels related to them.
